Welcome to the Science and Humanity Lab at the [Vermont Complex Systems Institute](https://vermontcomplexsystems.org/), where we model the human side of science. We mean this in both senses of the word:

1. we _build models_ to understand science as a complex social system, and
2. we _model how scientists_ can engage fiercely and objectively on pressing humanitarian questions.
