Welcome to the Science and Humanity Lab at the [Vermont Complex Systems Institute](https://vermontcomplexsystems.org/), where we use mathematical and computational tools to model the human side of science, in both senses of the word:

1. we _build models_ to understand science as a complex social system, and
2. we _model by example_ how scientists can engage fiercely and objectively on pressing humanitarian questions.
