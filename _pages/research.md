Welcome to the Science and Humanity Lab at the [Vermont Complex Systems Institute](https://vermontcomplexsystems.org/), where we model the human side of science. We mean this in both senses of the word: our group builds models to understand science as a complex social system, and we aim to model (i.e., demonstrate by example) how scientists can engage fiercely and objectively on humanitarian questions that affect us all.

The human side of science
======

Science is a human activity. To understand the scientific ecosystem, we have to understand the human beings --- you and me included --- who conduct experiments, write papers, apply for funding, run departments, and teach classes. Our lab examines the fingerprint of our humanity in our social structures and collective knowledge, such as the importance of [randomness in scientific careers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04414) (under review), the role of [labor in driving productivity](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abq7056) (_Science Advances_), [how reputation shapes faculty hiring](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05222-x#Bib1) (_Nature_), and how [even experts can be misled by common statistical graphics](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1702121114) (_PNAS_).


Quantitative human rights, justice, and policy
======

Our lab applies our mathematical and computational skills to make contributions to humanitarian questions, broadly, which includes human rights, criminal justice, and environmental policy. We have worked on Bayesian methods for [forensics human rights estimation](https://hrdag.org/tech-notes/implementing-lcmcr-in-stan.html) ([HRDAG](https://hrdag.org) blog post), developed a novel statistical approach to study [indignenous land rights and reforestation](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-64732-0) (_Nature Communications_), and are co-organizing a working group at the Santa Fe Institute on the [historical evolution of human rights](https://www.santafe.edu/events/understanding-the-historical-forces-driving-expansions-of-human-rights) in December.
