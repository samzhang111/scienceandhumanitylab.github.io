Sam Zhang is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, and the director of the Science and Humanity Lab. 
With his collaborators, he develops and applies methods drawing on mathematics, network science, and data science to examine how institutions shape scientific careers, how biases and hierarchies propagate through systems, and how quantitative approaches can inform humanitarian questions of rights, justice, and policy.
He received his PhD in Applied Mathematics at the University of Colorado, Boulder, during which he worked with the Human Rights Data Analysis Group and Microsoft Research NYC.
